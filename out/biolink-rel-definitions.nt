<https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/named_thing_category> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}" .
